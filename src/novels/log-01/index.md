## Observation Notes

During routine early-morning monitoring of Deep Trench sector B-13, observation window 4 captured unusual bioluminescent patterns at depth level 487m. The pattern exhibited rhythmic pulsation inconsistent with known deep-sea species in our catalog.

Initial analysis suggests possible undocumented cephalopod behavior, though pressure readings during the observation period showed minor anomalies (±0.3 bar fluctuation). Video feed timestamp experienced brief desynchronization lasting approximately 4.2 seconds.

Specimen collection attempted but unsuccessful. Observation window has been flagged for recalibration. Further monitoring scheduled.

## Technical Details

- **Image Quality:** 78% (minor corruption in lower-left quadrant)
- **Camera:** Subsurface Unit SSU-08
- **Light Source:** Infrared + UV composite
- **Exposure Time:** 0.8 seconds
- **Post-Processing:** Minimal color correction applied

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Recalibrate observation window sensors
- [ ] Cross-reference with historical bioluminescence database
- [ ] Schedule follow-up observation during same time window
- [x] Image archived in research database
